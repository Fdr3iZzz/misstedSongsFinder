# misstedSongsFinder
How to use:
- change String pathInput to where your folder with your playlists are
- change String pathOutput to where you want your txt files to be stored
- change String splitterTo the character after your number in the song naming scheme
- change String playlistFiles path to the path where your songs are stored

Errors in the naming scheme will result in the program crashing. You can see in the output where the crash occurred. To fix the program crashing you can add try catch exceptions but im too lazy for that
